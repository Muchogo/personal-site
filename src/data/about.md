I am a co-founder of [Vooka](https://arthena.com) where I build real esate and HRM solutions. I also advise startups and collaborate on numerous projects.
# Currently

At Vooka, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

# Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from a small but lovely town called Othaya. It tucked between Mt Kenya and the Aberdare ranges which means its cool or chilly most of the year. Sleepy hills , numerous crystal clear rivers, green vegetation, and fire flies (usually in the evening) give it a dreamy feel. Currently however, i live in Nairobi, a large city with many contracts.

# Fun facts

- I enjoy chilling withing a fine beer, wine is also ok.
- I excel at nearly all sports except swimming, table tennis and basket ball.
- I expecially love rugby
- I typically go with my gut feeling.
- I have large eyes that barely see.
- I enjoy listening to 80s and 90s music.

# I dream of

- always finding inspiration.
- enabling a brighter future.
- doing better.
